[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/vks-helm-charts)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=vks-helm-charts)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add vks-helm-charts https://vngcloud.github.io/vks-helm-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run `helm search repo vks-helm-charts` to see the charts.
